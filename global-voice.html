						<small>Currently no ability to toggle this functionality on front end. If slides have text-to-speech content, and you would like to disable text-to-speech, comment it out in the reveal.initialize dependencies. To disable text to speech on an individual slide, you could change the text-to-speech= property to equal something like silent="" for off or narration="" projecting a future capability to toggle optional narration. Other possibilities: Text-to-speech is only triggered by user if it is available to hear. Encourages observation before audio jarring. May be other narrative voice over capabilities than computer read voice, but this feature can be used to help time a presentation or hear how voice over operates with image. OR Narration is turned (by user) visiting a hyperlink that extends URL with something akin to ?=narrate, dependency triggers (in early init? or in classList callback of dependency list?) to parse text-to-speech content only when narration is set to on</small>

/0/WEATHER IN A TANK
How cool, rotating fluid experiments can—
—revolutionize our understanding of Earth's climate patterns.
By looking into the dynamics of water on a turntable— 
—we may reveal the flows & forces at work in our planetary weather systems. 




/1/FLUID ANALOGIES
Zones of Earth's atmosphere are modelable with a rotating fluid annulus.
Air and water are both fluids; one can be used to study the other.
Interactions between cool polar & warm equatorial air in the troposphere—
—can be investigated by creating temperature-density gradients in the fluid tank.
Spinning the turntable imparts upon the fluid properties analogous to planetary rotation.




/2/REPRESENTING EARTH'S ROTATION IN THE LAB
We match the west→east angular momentum Ω of the Earth about its axis with the turntable's spin.
Looking down above the pole, we direct it counterclockwise for the northern hemisphere.
Moving equatorward, a turntable speed of 10 rpm effects flows similar to middle latitudes.
As latitude φ decreases, so do effects of rotation; for the Tropics, we slow down to 1 rpm.
At the equator, the ground is perpendicular to the rotation axis, so we keep the turntable at rest.
Viewed from 'down under', the same west to east rotation is effectively clockwise for the S hemisphere.




/3/REPRESENTING TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IN THE LAB
The Sun's ~parallel rays are incident upon the spheroidal Earth at angles depending on latitude & time of year.
Tropical zones N & S of the equator, where rays are near perpendicular to the surface, receive more direct heating, concentrated upon a smaller area, and minimizing distance through the atmosphere.
In polar zones, sunlight enters at shallow angles, spreading over larger areas and passing through more atmosphere along the way. Even cooler, the poles emit more energy (in longwave infrared) than they take in.
We introduce a similar pole-equator temperature gradient by cooling the can center of the annulus with ice—
—leaving the warming action up to the laboratory's ambient room temperature.




/4/HADLEY HOW-TO
Setting up the experiment apparatus...
1. Place a clear acrylic tank and a metallic can with a weight @ center on the turntable.
2. Fill the tank with water up to a level under the can height, about 6-8 inches.
3. Spin up the turntable to 1 rpm & give ~10 minutes for the water to reach solid body rotation ↓
4. Add ice and some water to the center can to establish a temperature gradient.
5. Another 10 minutes allows flows to set up before adding tracers to visualize.


/4-1/SOLID BODY ROTATION
we add a paper dot to the rotating water
and view monitor its position
in the co-rotating frame
the tank has reached solid body rotation
when the surface floating particle appears still




/5/VISUALIZING FLOWS
We use tracers of distinct buoyancies to reveal flows at various levels in the fluid volume.
Paper dots (leftover from a hole punch) will float on the fluid's upper surface, tracing its currents.
Color dye drops create plumes that disperse as directed by currents of the working fluid interior.
Pink permanganate crystals cast streamers as they sink to tank bottom—
—where they act as a point sources spreading to stain the lowest of the fluid's flows.




/6/CO-ROTATING PREDICTION
Moving from the lab frame of reference to an overhead camera co-rotating in sync with the turntable—
—we can get a steady view of how the tracers spread through the tank. Observers outside the frame appear to be rotating in the opposite direction.
Within this reference frame, visualize how the color tracers might behave when released into the water.

/13/BOTTOM FLOWS
fast forward of permangante crystal spread
radially outward + circumferentially clockwise ( in that wise, counter to table/system rotation !) 
as the spread reaches the warm periphery, it heats and tends to rise




/14/GREEN DYE WOUND UP

upper fluid tends to move circumferentially faster in the direction of the turntable, radially slowly inward to the cold sink
clear upper fluid getting cold, sinking along can walls




/15/PARTICLE VELOCITIES
paper dots tend to move slower the further they are away from the cool core
these measures can be catalogged relative to radius
and compared to slope of the dome surface, akin to a front in a tank
